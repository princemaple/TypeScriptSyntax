# TypeScript Syntax

This package makes Microsoft's [TypeScript-TmLanguage](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage) available without also having to run the entire [TypeScript plugin](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TypeScript). This is useful when you don't need the language services from that package, or when you're using a separate [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) implementation.
